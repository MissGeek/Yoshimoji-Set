# Description and infos

The Yoshimoji Set is a pack of different emoticons featuring Yoshi, the little green dino from the Mario serie.

The character itself is property of Nintendo, but those icons are fully made from scratch and so, they don't use any existing base art.

The set is available in 10 colors : Green, Red, Pink, Blue, Light blue, Yellow, Orange, Purple, White and Black

Program used : GIMP 2.8

You may :
- Use them for your bulletin board and on DeviantART.
- Propose new emoticons for this pack, as long as the style is consistent.  If you do so, your name will be added in the credits list.

You may not :
- Take credit for these emoticons.  If someone asks you who made these, please link back to this GitHub page !
- Make commercial use of them, except on sites displaying ads (ex: free forum services, social media)
